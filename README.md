##    Capstone Project
- 🧠 [Attention-based MIL (UBC-OCEAN)](https://github.com/karthikgs-in/attention-mil-ubc-ocean)  
  Research project | Presented at ICMBNT 2025
  1️⃣ Private test score matched the top 10 % of the leaderboard.
  2️⃣ Achieved ~75 % improvement over baseline (Private 0.24 → 0.42).
  3️⃣ Efficient Lunit DINO ViT + ABMIL pipeline with PyVips tile processing enabled fast training (~1 s/epoch) and significant inference speed-up.

##  Competitions/Hackathons
- 🧬 [Disease Prediction from Chest X-rays](https://github.com/karthikgs-in/chest-xray-multimodal-hackathon)  
  Hybrid CNN + Tabular data | PyTorch | Hackathon Finalist
- Capstone emerged out of participation in Kaggle UBC-OCEAN competition.
  - A baseline with InceptionV3 was submitted in time for the competition deadline.
  - Thesis matched top 10% leaderboard on generalization (balanced accuracy).
- [LLM Classification Finetuning](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-classification-finetuning/)
  -  Ranked 74 on leaderboard (As of 12th Nov, 2025)
-  [Predicting the Beats-per-Minute of Songs](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e9/leaderboard)
    -  Built a stacked XGBoost Regressor to predict BPM

## 🎓 Course Projects
 - Big Data for Machine Learning - practical familiarity with distributed data processing (HDFS, MapReduce, SparkSQL/PySpark), structured storage (Hive), data movement (Sqoop via AWS RDS), and NoSQL operations (MongoDB). Worked hands-on with Databricks notebooks and DBFS for Spark cluster setup, AWS-compatible workflows, and data export.
 - Data Visualization - Billionaires Dashboard
   - Built interactive Tableau dashboards visualizing Forbes billionaire data, comparing India vs world by net worth, industry, and demographics. Derived insights on wealth distribution, self-made status, and industry dominance through calculated fields, filters, and story-driven visual design.
- Data Visualization - [WHO Life Expectancy dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/LifeExpectancy_17263939230530/LifeExpectancydashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link))
  - Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard using WHO life expectancy data to explore the impact of health, economic, and social indicators. Integrated multi-variable trends across countries and years to highlight longevity disparities between developing and developed nations.

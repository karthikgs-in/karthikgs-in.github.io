## 🎓 Course Projects
 - Big Data for Machine Learning - practical familiarity with distributed data processing (HDFS, MapReduce, SparkSQL/PySpark), structured storage (Hive), data movement (Sqoop via AWS RDS), and NoSQL operations (MongoDB). Worked hands-on with Databricks notebooks and DBFS for Spark cluster setup, AWS-compatible workflows, and data export.
 - Data Visualization - Billionaires Dashboard
   - Built two interactive Tableau dashboards visualizing Forbes billionaire data, comparing India vs world by net worth, industry, and demographics. Derived insights on wealth distribution, self-made status, and industry dominance through calculated fields, filters, and story-driven visual design.
- Data Visualization - [WHO Life Expectancy dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/LifeExpectancy_17263939230530/LifeExpectancydashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link))
  - Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard using WHO life expectancy data to explore the impact of health, economic, and social indicators. Integrated multi-variable trends across countries and years to highlight longevity disparities between developing and developed nations.

👋 Hi, I'm Karthik GS

M.Tech in AI & Data Science | CGPA 9.89 | Focus: Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Generative AI (GenAI)

🧭 Professional Work
🧠 Data Science Consultant — Brain Imaging Team, University of Calgary (Remote)

Developing course chapters and Python code for undergraduate Biomedical Data Analytics course (UCalgary BMEN415).

Building machine learning workflows for data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and visualization.

Applied supervised learning (classification, regression) using linear, tree-based, and ensemble models.

Introduced students to neural networks and deep learning (CNNs for medical imaging, GANs for synthetic data generation).

Investigating Generative AI (ChatGPT) for course design and assessment preparation.

Managing webpage, LaTeX documentation (resumes, papers), bibliography, and Python automation scripts for file processing.

🏺 The Indus Script Project (IM77 – Roja Muthiah Research Library)

Built indusscript.in
 — a Flutter/Dart Progressive Web App (PWA) for the Indus Script Digital Archive.

Integrated Firebase OAuth for authentication and Firestore for structured Indus text data storage.

Created an end-to-end SQLite → JSON → Firestore ingestion pipeline using Python and Node.js via Google Cloud Storage.

Demonstrated full-stack expertise across Flutter PWA design, Firebase integration, and cloud-based data workflows.

📚 Library Data Analytics — Roja Muthiah Research Library

Processed and merged Excel datasets using pandas, openpyxl, and itertools, performing cleaning and normalization.

Applied textdistance (Jaccard similarity) for clustering near-duplicate or related records.

Enriched and synchronized metadata, exporting both clustered and unclustered Excel outputs for archival consistency.

🎓 Capstone Project (M.Tech)
🧬 Attention-based MIL for UBC-OCEAN Dataset

Research Project | Presented at ICMBNT 2025

🏆 Private test score matched top 10% of leaderboard.

🚀 ~75% improvement over baseline (Private 0.24 → 0.42).

⚙️ Built an Efficient Lunit DINO ViT + ABMIL pipeline with PyVips tile processing — enabling ~1 s/epoch training and fast inference.

🧩 Competitions & Hackathons

🩻 Disease Prediction from Chest X-rays

Hybrid CNN + Tabular data | PyTorch | Hackathon Finalist

Capstone evolved from Kaggle UBC-OCEAN participation; baseline used InceptionV3; achieved top 10% generalization.

🧠 LLM Classification Finetuning

Used intfloat/e5-large | Ranked #74 on leaderboard (as of Nov 2025).

🎵 Playground Series – Predicting Beats-per-Minute of Songs

Built a stacked XGBoost regressor to predict BPM from song metadata.

📘 Selected Course Projects (M.Tech)
💾 Big Data for Machine Learning

Worked hands-on with distributed data frameworks — HDFS, MapReduce, SparkSQL/PySpark, Hive, and MongoDB.

Implemented data pipelines via Sqoop (AWS RDS) and Databricks notebooks using DBFS for cluster orchestration and export.

📊 Data Visualization — Billionaires Dashboard

Designed interactive Tableau dashboards visualizing Forbes billionaire data (India vs World).

Compared net worth, industry, and demographics; explored self-made trends using calculated fields, filters, and story-driven design.

🌍 Data Visualization — WHO Life Expectancy Dashboard

Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze health, economic, and social indicators influencing life expectancy.

Visualized multi-variable trends across countries and years to highlight disparities between developing and developed nations.
